const variable cannot be changed once declared
let is used for without scope(anywhere)
var is used for scope variables , so not to use "var"

variable are "undefined", when value is not assigned to it.

//5
"use strict"; //treat all js code as newer version

alert has different syntax in node, so it gives error
alert(3+3)

=>number is 2 to power 53
=>bigint(for bigger number)
=>string => ""
=>boolean=> true/false
=>null=> standalone value/assigned value=> null is of object type
=>undefined=> only declare but not assigned a value => undefined is itself a type 
=>symbol =>unique
=>object

number
eg:   let score=33

string
eg:   let score="33"

converting value from number to string=>
let score="33"

let valueInNumber=Number(score)
console.log(typeof valueInNumber)      //number

NaN datatype=> it is also a datatype
let score="33abc" 

let valueInNumber=Number(score)
console.log(valueInNumber)       //gives NAn as value

//7
converting value into negative=>
let value =3
let negValue= -value
console.log(negValue);

//8
comparing 2 different datatypes=>
console.log("2">1);      //true
console.log("02">1);      //true

Strict check by triple equal(===)=> it check number & datatype also
console.log("2"===2);

//10
object is stored in heap=>
eg:

let userOne={
    email: "user@google.com",
    upi: "user@ybl"
}

let userTwo=userOne

userTwo.email="sama@google.com"

console.log(userOne.email);
console.log(userTwo.email);    

both gives same answer as sama@google.com

//11
string declarations=>
const name="hitesh"

const gameName=new String('Samaaaaa');
