const variable cannot be changed once declared
let is used for without scope(anywhere)
var is used for scope variables , so not to use "var"

variable are "undefined", when value is not assigned to it.

//5
"use strict"; //treat all js code as newer version

alert has different syntax in node, so it gives error
alert(3+3)

=>number is 2 to power 53
=>bigint(for bigger number)
=>string => ""
=>boolean=> true/false
=>null=> standalone value/assigned value=> null is of object type
=>undefined=> only declare but not assigned a value => undefined is itself a type 
=>symbol =>unique
=>object

//6
number
eg:   let score=33

string
eg:   let score="33"

converting value from number to string=>
let score="33"

let valueInNumber=Number(score)
console.log(typeof valueInNumber)      //number

NaN datatype=> it is also a datatype
let score="33abc" 

let valueInNumber=Number(score)
console.log(valueInNumber)       //gives NAn as value

//7
converting value into negative=>
let value =3
let negValue= -value
console.log(negValue);

//8
comparing 2 different datatypes=>
console.log("2">1);      //true
console.log("02">1);      //true

Strict check by triple equal(===)=> it check number & datatype also
console.log("2"===2);

//10
object is stored in heap=>
eg:

let userOne={
    email: "user@google.com",
    upi: "user@ybl"
}

let userTwo=userOne

userTwo.email="sama@google.com"

console.log(userOne.email);
console.log(userTwo.email);    

both gives same answer as sama@google.com

//11
string declarations=>
const name="hitesh"

const gameName=new String('Samaaaaa');

//13
Date is object in js

//14
Array
const myHeros=["Shaktiman","naagraj"]

const myArr2=new Array(1,2,3,4)
console.log(myArr[1]);

//Array methods

// myArr.push(6)
// myArr.push(7)
// myArr.pop()               //remove last value

myArr.unshift(9);            //add value at first
myArr.shift()                 //remove first value

console.log(myArr.includes(9));       //check

//console.log(myArr.indexOf(3));       //gives index

const newArr=myArr.join()     //joining one array with another

const myn1=myArr.slice(1,3)   //slicing one array

console.log(myn1);
console.log("B ",myArr);

const myn2=myArr.splice(1,3)           //it removes content from original array i.e manipulate it

//15
console.log(Array.isArray("Hitesh"));  //is that named array is present
console.log(Array.from("Hitesh"));       //create the array with that string
console.log(Array.from({name:"Hitesh"}));

//16
Objects=>>
const Jsuser={
    name:"hitesh",           //key-value
    "full name":"xyx abc",                 //when key is written with double quote it cannot be accessed with .
    age:18,
    location:"Pune",
    email:"xyz@gmail.com",
    isLoggedIn:false,
    lastloginDays:["Monday","Saturday"]
}

console.log(Jsuser.email);
console.log(Jsuser["email"])
console.log(Jsuser["full name"]);        //imp

when u want to use symbol in the object, we have to declare it with square brackets
eg:
const mySym=Symbol("key1")

const Jsuser={
    name:"hitesh",           //key-value
    "full name":"xyx abc",
    [mySym]:"mykey1",                       
    age:18,
    location:"Pune",
    email:"xyz@gmail.com",
    isLoggedIn:false,
    lastloginDays:["Monday","Saturday"]
}

when u freeze the object , it will not change the changes u do after it
eg:
Jsuser.email="hitu@gmail.com"             
Object.freeze(Jsuser)
Jsuser.email="hituuuuu@gmail.com"         //it will not change
console.log(Jsuser)            

//18
destructuring objects=>
eg:
const {courseInstructor}=course
const {courseInstructor:instructor}=course

//console.log(courseInstructor)
console.log(instructor)

//19
functions=>
returning value from function:
eg: 
function addTwoNumbers(number1 ,number2){
   let result=number1+number2
   return result
}

eg:
function loginUserMessage(username){
    return `${username} just logged in`
}

console.log(loginUserMessage("hitesh"))

//20
variable declared inside the block cannot be accessed outside the block
if(true){
    let a=10
    const b=20
    var c=30
}

console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);

variable declared with "var " inside the block,can be accessed outside the block ===> so, don't use var

//25
Javascript Execution Context=>
{}=========> Global Execution Context => this variable stores Global Execution Context
In browser, "this" value is window object

There are 3 types of Execution Context=>1. Global Execution Context
                                      =>2. function Execution Context
                                      =>3. Eval Execution Context

this run in 2 phases=>1. Memory Creation phase
                    =>2. Execution phase

Steps=> 1. Global Execution(/Environment) in "this" variable
     => 2. Memory Phase => here, all variable name are stored as "undefined" in Memory creation phase
                        => then, all function defination is also stored in Memory creation phase
     => 3. Execution Phase=> then value is assigned with all variables
                          => it will Execute functions with Execution Context which
                          => Generally new function create new Execution Context with new variable Environment & Execution thread in it
                          => so, it will execute again like Memory creation phase & Execution phase for a function only(not global)
                          => function return value is returned/stored to global Execution Context
                          => then it will delete function Execution Context

=>CallStack(LIFO)=> first,global execution context then functions push & pop in stack frame
